### Problem Statement:

Forecasting the future values has always been one of the most challenging problems in the field. More specifically, the primary goal here is to focus on the problem of forecasting future values of number of ads being watched per hour in a real mobile game.

### Dataset:

The Ads dataset consists of approximately 215 time series. Each of these time series represents ads being watched per hour starting from September 13 2017 to September 22 2017. The currency dataset consists of 300 time series. Each of the time series represents in-game currency being spent per day starting from May 1st 2017 to February 24th 2018.
